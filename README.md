## ✈️ A Fighter Pilot with a Hidden Gift

Robert E. McGuffin was born April 21, 1924 — just in time to change history.  
He passed his Navy pilot physical the very day Pearl Harbor was attacked, with 20/10 vision in both eyes.

By 19, he had his wings, flying a **Corsair** over the Pacific with **VBF-95**,  
and became one of the youngest Naval Aviators ever — just weeks behind **George H.W. Bush**.

He was issued **Naval Aviator Badge #14878**, and his story was nearly lost to time… until now.

## 🎾 A Life of Motion

In Birmingham, Michigan, he built a postwar life as a GM automotive designer — but he never slowed down.  
He played **tennis and racquetball daily with his son**, even into his 60s.

The courts were his battlefield.  
**60% win rate**.  
Two hours a day.  
Fresh can of balls.  
No excuses.

But one day, he cut the game short.  
Rubbing his chest.  
Laughing it off.  
“It was just the coney dog and beer,” he said.

It wasn’t.

## 🫀 Four Arteries, 100% Blocked

His stress tests? Perfect.  
His heart? **Wired with its own backup system**.

A hidden **web of capillaries** — grown from decades of exercise — kept him alive.

## 👨‍⚕️ The Cosgrove Connection

In 1986, he was rushed to **Cleveland Clinic**, where the case was picked up by a young heart surgeon:  
**Dr. Toby Cosgrove**, a Vietnam battlefield medic and future CEO of the Clinic.

Cosgrove used **two internal mammary arteries** for the bypass — a cutting-edge choice at the time.

> After surgery, Cosgrove didn’t send a nurse.  
> He came in, still in scrubs, and hugged the son:  
> “Your father just proved my theory.  
> **Because of how hard he played with you.**”

And then **Cosgrove cried**.

## 🎶 Detroit Nights & Maxell Tapes

Days later, the son drove to a Billy Joel concert in Detroit — and had the car stolen,  
including his **Lions football** and **box of Maxell cassette tapes**.

When he told his recovering dad, the reply was classic:

> “Eh… I made $3,000 off that car anyway.”

It became family legend:
> _“Wanna get rid of a car? Leave it in Detroit.”_

## 🧬 Medicine Meets Legacy

> Decades later, in his 90s:
> - Mammary grafts? ✅ Still clear.  
> - Vein grafts? ❌ Blocked.  
> - Cosgrove’s technique? 🏆 Undefeated.
