### 🎾 A Father’s Fire Meets a Clue

Picture a retired GM designer from **Birmingham, Michigan** — tree-lined streets, tennis courts alive — who hated losing so much he’d beat his **collegiate tennis-star son** (me!) **60% of the time** at 63.

But racquetball?  
That’s where I, a **state-top player**, held the edge —  
until he quit mid-match, blaming a coney and beer. 🌭🍺

That’s when I knew:  
Something was wrong beneath his grit.  
A heart mystery was brewing.

### 🫀 A Medical Marvel Unveiled

Four coronary arteries — **100% blocked**.  
**No heart attacks**.

How?

His heart *rewrote the playbook*,  
spinning a web of capillaries from a lifetime of motion.

**Dr. Toby Cosgrove** — Vietnam vet, surgical genius —  
opened his chest in 1986 and wept,  
not from fatigue,  
but *awe*.

This isn’t just a procedure.  
It’s a **father-son epic** of instinct, resilience,  
and nature defying the odds.

### 💨 Detroit Nights and Stolen Soul

Imagine me, snagging Dad’s **maroon Pontiac Grand Am**  
for **Billy Joel** at **Joe Louis Arena**.

Parked in a lit lot, security booth nearby —  
gone by night’s end. 💨

Lost?

- 🏈 My **Lions football**  
- 📼 A box of **Maxell tapes** — my soul on cassette

Dad’s take?

> *“Made $3,000 off it anyway.”* 😎

A twist that’ll make you laugh through the sting.

### 🧬 A Legacy That Endures

Decades later:  
Those rare **mammary artery grafts** Cosgrove dared to use?  
**Crystal clear** in his 90s. 💡

The **veins faltered**, but the **heart roared on**.

This is a man who outran death  
**one backhand at a time**,  
a surgeon who hugged me in wonder,  
and a family tale that’ll spark belief in **miracles**.

  A father’s quiet fight and a son’s first clue to history.
